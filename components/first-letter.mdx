You may have heard about great IRL hackathons, but if you’re in high school you
probably haven’t been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit, and now
they're missing from our new normal.

**Our summer project is to kick off a hackathon renaissance, together.**
We'll begin in San Francisco on August 5th, and we ask for you to join us!

This is your invitation to meet and make mischief.
