We're starting in San Francisco and we invite you to join us. Not through Zoom,
Discord or Devpost, but IRL in the heart of the city for a hackathon of the
ages. Youâ€™ll explore the Bay Area during your free time, hack with
co-conspirators, solve a mystery at midnight, and experience the energy of being
in-person again.

We can't do this alone. After Assemble, we'll open source the entire event,
launch a guide to creating a hackathon and work with you to start your own
hackathon. Together, we'll kick start a high school hackathon renaissance.
