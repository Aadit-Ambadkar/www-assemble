Dear reader, viewer, person behind the screen,

You’ve probably heard about great IRL hackathons, but if you’re our age you
probably haven’t been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit and now they
seem to be missing from our new normal.

The legends from before still linger… <a href="https://windyhacks.com" target="_blank">Windy City Hacks</a>, 
<a href="https://2018.hackchicago.io" target="_blank">Hack Chicago</a> & 
<a href="https://hackpenn.com" target="_blank">Hack Pennsylvania</a>, to name a few. If you were a freshman when the pandemic hit, you’re 
now an upcoming senior and still haven’t had the chance to visit a hackathon.

Even if you’ve been to a hackathon since, it was probably online. You may have
joined a Discord server just to lurk and eventually leave because of spam. Or maybe
you couldn’t find the energy from a pale Devpost page. We’re tired of virtual
hackathons and we imagine you are too.

Our summer project is to kick off a new renaissance.

**We're returning in-person high-school hackathons to San Francisco**. 

We invite you, behind the screen, to come out and join us. Not through Zoom,
Discord or Devpost, but IRL out in the Golden City. You’ll explore the Bay Area 
during your free time, hack with co-conspirators, solve a murder at midnight, and
experience the energy of being in-person again. Together, we’ll assemble to form 
the first IRL high school hackathon on this side of the pandemic.

**Hackers, [assemble](https://assemble.hackclub.com/register)!**
