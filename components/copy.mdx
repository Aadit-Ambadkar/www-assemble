Dear reader, viewer, person behind the screen,

You may have heard about great IRL hackathons, but if you’re our age you
probably haven’t been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit and now they
seem to be missing from our new normal.

The legends from before still linger… <a href="https://windyhacks.com" target="_blank">
Windy City Hacks</a>, <a href="https://2018.hackchicago.io" target="_blank">Hack Chicago</a>
& <a href="https://hackpenn.com" target="_blank">Hack Pennsylvania</a>, to name a few.
But if you’ve been to a hackathon since, it was probably online. We’re tired of virtual
hackathons and we imagine you are too.

**Our summer project is to kick off a new renaissance, together.**

We're starting in San Francisco and we invite you to join us. Not through Zoom,
Discord or Devpost, but IRL in the heart of city for a hackathon of the ages. You’ll explore the Bay Area
during your free time, hack with co-conspirators, solve a murder at midnight, and
experience the energy of being in-person again.

We can't do this alone. After Assemble, we'll open source the entire event, launch a guide to creating a hackathon and work with you to start your own hackathon. Together, we'll kick start a high school hackathon renaissance.

**Hackers, [assemble](https://airtable.com/shrqNfrlrI6JT5XYP)!**
