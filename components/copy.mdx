Dear reader, viewer, person behind the screen,

You’ve probably heard about great IRL hackathons, but if you’re our age you
probably haven’t gone to one.  They vanished when the pandemic hit and now they
seem to be missing from our new normal.

The legends from before still linger… Windy City Hacks, Hack Cinnicinati & Hack
Pennsylvania to name a few. If you were a freshman when the pandemic hit, you’re 
now an upcoming senior and still haven’t had a chance to visit a hackathon.

But if you’ve been to a hackathon since, it was probably online. You may have
joined a Discord server just to lurk and eventually leave from spam. Or maybe
you couldn’t find the energy from a pale Devpost page. We’re tired of virtual
hackathons and we imagine you are too.

**We're going to return in-person high-school hackathons to San Francisco**. Our
summer project is to kick off a new renaissance.

We invite you, behind the screen, to come out and join us. Not through Zoom or
Discord, but IRL out in the Golden City. You’ll explore the Bay Area during your
free time, hack with co-conspirators, solve a murder at midnight, and experience
the energy of being in-person again. Together, we’ll assemble IRL to set the standard
for high school hackathons this side of the pandemic.

**Hackers, assemble!**
