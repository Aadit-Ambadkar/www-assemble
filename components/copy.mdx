You may have heard about great IRL hackathons, but if you’re our age you
probably haven’t been to one. They vanished when the pandemic hit and now they
seem to be missing from our new normal.

**Our summer project is to kick off a new renaissance, together.**

We're starting in San Francisco and we invite you to join us. Not through Zoom,
Discord or Devpost, but IRL in the heart of the city for a hackathon of the ages. You’ll explore the Bay Area
during your free time, hack with co-conspirators, solve a murder at midnight, and
experience the energy of being in-person again.

We can't do this alone. After Assemble, we'll open source the entire event, launch a guide to creating a hackathon and work with you to start your own hackathon. Together, we'll kick start a high school hackathon renaissance.

**Hackers, [assemble](https://airtable.com/shrqNfrlrI6JT5XYP)!**
